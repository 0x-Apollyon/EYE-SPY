            Well its me, Aditya Manuja, a 16 year old (2007 born) highschool student currently studying in grade 12th. 
            <br>
            I have been a cybersecurity, cryptography and coding enthusiast for quite some time now. I have come from writing my first scratch game when I was 10 to now running EYE-SPY, protecting peoples personal data. 
            <br>
            Apart from this I also conduct some pentests on websites and work on bug bounties. I also have a small list of projects publicly avaiable on my <a href="https://github.com/0x-Apollyon"> github account </a>. I also have multiple private projects that I dont want to show publicly.
