            EYE - SPY
        </H1>
        <BR>
        <H2>
          So you were contacted by a malicious indiviual, now, what to do ?
        </H2>
        <BR>
        <H3>
            Step 1: Malware removal
        </H3>
        <P>
            Disinfect your device. There is a high probability that the malware which led to your data being stolen in the first place is still active. You can either do this yourself (ONLY IF YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING, DONT DO THIS IF YOU DONT HAVE KNOWLEDGE ABOUT MALWARE) or use an antivirus software. There are many good AV softwares in the market. I personally use <a href="https://www.kaspersky.co.in/downloads">Kaspersky</a> on many of my devices and even its free tier is very good. I also find the default windows defender very useless so I suggest not to use that.
        </P>
        <H3>
            Step 2: Attacker access revoked 
        </H3>
        <P>
            Reset all your passwords. This includes the passwords saved in your browser, password manager and places where you might have reused the same passwords. Do it ASAP and you will be able to stop the malicious actor / hacker from causing any more damage
        </P>
        <H3>
            Step 3: Downloads introspection
        </H3>
        <P>
            Try to think about what you might have downloaded which caused this. Game cheats ? , Hack Tools ?, Cracked software ?, Spam scripts or something else. You can use a service like <A href="https://www.virustotal.com/gui">virustotal</A> or <A href = "https://malcore.io/">malcore</A> to scan the indiviual files to determine wether they are malicious. If you dont find anything which is malicious but still think some download is suspicious, you can  <A href="./about.html"> send it to us</A> for inspection.
        </P>
        <H3>
            Step 4: Damage control
        </H3>
        <P>
            Check your accounts, especially those ones which were saved in your browser autofill. Also check all your financial accounts like bank accounts and cryptocurrency wallets for signs of malicious activity. If you had sensitive files stored on your computer, you should also take steps to prevent them from being mis used. For example many stolen IDs are used for identity theft and financial fraud.
        </P>
        <H3>
            Step 5: You have engaged law enforcement
        </H3>
        <P>
            If you see that any funds have been stolen or you detect misuse of stolen data which is causing real harm, you should contact law enforcement and work with them.
        </P>
        <H3>
            Step 6: Prevention is better than the cure
