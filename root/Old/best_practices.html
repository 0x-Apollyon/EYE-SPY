          Prevent getting hacked and save your data from being stolen

            USE A SECURE PASSWORD MANAGER
        </H3>
        <P>
            Most of a persons data is stolen from passwords stored in cleartext files or saving them in the inbuilt password managers webbrowsers like Edge, Chrome and Brave have.
            There are many password managers out in the market. I personally use <A href="https://keepassxc.org">KeepassXC </A>and would like to suggest it to everyone reading this.
        </P>
        <H3>
            DO NOT RE-USE PASSWORDS
        </H3>
        <P>
            Do not re-use passwords. If you re-use passwords and one of them get leaked, that means a threat actor can access all the accounts linked with that password. This also includes common iterations of the password such as adding @123 to the end of the password. These small iterations are of no use and can be easily overcome by threat actors/ hackers. You can use a secure password generator. I personally use the password generator inbuilt into <A href="https://keepassxc.org">KeepassXC </A>

        <H3>
            USE A GOOD ANTI VIRUS SOFTWARE
        </H3>
        <P>
            A good anti virus can often detect malware when you download them and prevent you from running it. There are many good AV softwares in the market. I personally use <a href="https://www.kaspersky.co.in/downloads">Kaspersky</a> on many of my devices and even its free tier is very good. I also find the default windows defender very useless so I suggest not to use that.
        </P>
        <H3>
            DO NOT DOWNLOAD AND RUN RANDOM FILES
        </H3>
        <P>
            Dont download suspicious files you find on the internet. Even if you do download these files, you should scan them by using some malware analysis tools. You can use a service like <A href="https://www.virustotal.com/gui">Virustotal</A> or <A href = "https://malcore.io/">Malcore</A> to scan the indiviual files to determine wether they are malicious.
        </P>
        <H3>
            STORE CONFIDENTIAL AND PRIVATE FILES AFTER ENCRYPTING THEM
        </H3>
        <P>
            Private and confidential files such as company documents, government IDs and other files should be stored only after encrypting them with a secure encryption algortihm. You can use software such as <A href="https://www.veracrypt.fr/en/Home.html"> Veracrypt </A> and <A href="https://proton.me/drive"> Proton Drive </A> for this.
